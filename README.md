Thank everybody for the feedback. We have learned your feedback and decided to simplify our code structure to make it easier to use.
Code is this repo **will be deprecated soon**! Please move to the new codebase that is actively developed and maintained. The list of the new

[NVIDIA Cosmos](https://www.nvidia.com/cosmos/) is a developer-first world foundation model platform designed to help Physical AI developers build their Physical AI systems better and faster. Cosmos contains

1. Pre-trained models (available via Hugging Face) under the [NVIDIA Open Model License](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/) that allows free commercial use.
2. Pre-training, post-training, and inference code (available in native PyTorch) under the [Apache 2 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

There are three main model families in Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform.

1. [Cosmos Predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict1): a collection of general-purpose world models for future state prediction.

2. [Cosmos Transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1): a collection of multimodal conditional world generation model for various domain transfer applications such as Sim2Real.

3. [Cosmos Reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1): a collection of Physical AI reasoning models for planning and critics.

Being a minimalist, we have these individual models in individual repositories under [nvidia-github](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos).
